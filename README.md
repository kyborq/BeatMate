# BeatMate

BeatMate is a mobile application that allows you to enjoy music together with friends and other people nearby. You can add your friends to the app and share your music with them. You can also listen to music in real time with your friends and chat with them.

One of the unique features of the BeatMate app is the ability to add your tracks to playlists of nearby users by location. This means that if you are in a taxi or on public transport, you can simply log in to the app, see which playlists are currently playing nearby, and offer your tracks to the playback queue. If the user approves your track, it will be added to the playlist and played by all participants offline.

BeatMate is the perfect way to connect with new people and enjoy music with them.
